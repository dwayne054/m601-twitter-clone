1. Project Setup and Planning
Set up your project structure: Organize your files into directories (e.g., css for stylesheets, js for JavaScript files, and maybe lib for external libraries).
Initial setup with Firebase: Go to the Firebase console, create a new project, and set up Firebase Authentication and Firestore Database. Familiarize yourself with Firebase documentation related to these services.
Planning: Write down the features and functionalities you need to implement, prioritizing them from essential to nice-to-have. This could be in the form of a checklist or a Kanban board using tools like Trello.
2. Database Setup
Define collections: Plan your Firestore data model. Typically, you'll need at least two collections: users (for user profiles) and tweets (for tweets).
Document structure: Decide on the structure of documents within these collections, considering fields like userId, tweetContent, createdAt for tweets, and email, displayName for users.
3. User Authentication
Authentication pages: Design and implement the UI for sign-up, login, and password reset pages.
Integrate Firebase Authentication: Use Firebase to add authentication logic. Start with email and password for simplicity.
Input validation and error handling: Ensure you validate inputs on the client side and provide useful feedback for errors.
4. User Management
Registration form: Implement the form where users can sign up.
Storing user info: After a successful signup, store additional user info in the Firestore users collection.
Profile updates and password changes: Provide interfaces and functionality for these actions.
5. Tweet Creation
Tweet composition UI: Create a simple and intuitive interface for writing and submitting tweets.
Tweet validation: Prevent empty tweets and apply any necessary limits (e.g., character count).
Saving tweets: Implement the logic to save tweets to your Firestore database, linking them to the authenticated user.
6. Tweet Display
Fetching and displaying tweets: Retrieve tweet documents from Firestore and display them. Consider using real-time data for an interactive experience.
Pagination or infinite scrolling: Implement a strategy for efficiently loading tweets to avoid overwhelming the user or the network.
7. Edit and Delete Tweets
UI for editing and deleting: Provide buttons or links for these actions on each tweet, ensuring they're only visible to the tweet's author.
Implementing edit and delete functionality: Use Firestore to update or remove the selected tweet.
8. Responsive Design
CSS and media queries: Ensure your layouts adapt to different screen sizes. Start mobile-first and then expand to accommodate tablets and desktops.
9. User Experience and Interface
Look and feel: Aim for a design that's clean and intuitive, drawing inspiration from Twitter for familiarity.
Feedback and error handling: Implement clear and immediate feedback for user actions, especially for form submissions and error states.
10. Final Steps
Testing: Test your application thoroughly on different devices and browsers to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
Documentation: Write clear documentation, including how to set up the Firebase project, any external libraries used, and how to run your application.
Submission preparation: Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and organized. Prepare a compressed folder of your project for submission.
